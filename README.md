# Tire Detection and Counting

This project is designed to detect and count tires using a YOLOv8 model integrated with DeepSORT for object tracking. The project supports four different scenarios:

1. **Image Detection**
2. **Video Detection**
3. **Real-Time Detection**
4. **IP Camera Detection**

## Overview

This project leverages the power of deep learning and computer vision to detect and count tires in various scenarios. The YOLOv8 model is used for tire detection, while DeepSORT is employed to track and count the detected tires across frames in video streams.
